# Backend (Express) - Web Programlama

This is a minimal Express backend scaffold for the project.

Quick start (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd server
npm install
npm run start
```

The server runs on port 4000 by default. Endpoints:
- `GET /api/ping` — simple health check
- `GET /api/tables` — returns three empty tables (placeholder)

You can use `npm run dev` if you want to use `nodemon` for auto-restart during development.
